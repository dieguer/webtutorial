The process is very well explained on their documentation.\nAs advocates for free technology we are going to opt for a second way to modify and deploy your website using your own PC and Github Pages.\nIn this iteration we are going to proceed with the setup steps that you will have to do before actually modifying and deploying your website.\nInstall Required software R and Rstudio In order to make your personal website you will first need to install R for your operating system. YOu will also need an installation of RStudio.\nYou can follow the instructions in the following tutorial\nInstall git Depending on your OS you will need to install git. YOu can follow the instructions in the following page:\nHugo installation (OS dependent) Windows First install Scoop. This is a package manager that works similar to the package managers in Linux.\nAccess Windows Powershell and type:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex\r Reply yes to the question: Do you want to change the execution policy?\nInstall Hugo and its dependencies by typing:\nscoop install git go hugo-extended\r MacOS Open the Terminal\nInstall Homebrew, the Mac package manager, by pasting the following command and pressing the Enter\n/bin/bash -c \u0026quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\u0026quot;\r update the repositories\nbrew update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; brew upgrade\r Install Hugo and its dependencies:\nbrew install git golang hugo\nOpen the hidden ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc) file in a text editor, add the following line, and restart your Terminal app so that Hugo can find the location of its Go dependency.\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\r Linux For Ubuntu based distributions\nDownload the Hugo Extended installer for Debian (hugo_extended__Linux-64bit.deb)\nOpen a terminal on the directory where you placed your installer and type\nsudo dpkg -i \u0026lt;path_to_deb_file\u0026gt;/hugo_extended_\u0026lt;VERSION\u0026gt;_Linux-64bit.deb\r Download a template The provider wowchemy has six different templates you can use:\n Academic/Resum√© Researcher Research Group Blog Project Documentation Hello World  For this tutorial we are going to use the first.\nTo proceed go to the directory where you want to create your website using your file explorer and open a terminal. If you are using WIndows you should open a power shell. Now download the template by typing:\ngit clone https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic.git\r Once you have cloned the repository, go to the location of the repository on the file typing:\ncd \u0026lt;your-path\u0026gt;/starter-academic\r You can view the template by typing:\nhugo server\r If no errors are shown in the compilation you can paste the following on the address bar of your web browser:\nhttp://localhost:1313/\r Setting up R-studio Stop the compilation by pressing Crtl+c. Then go to your website folder by typing:\ncd \u0026lt;your-path\u0026gt;/starter-academic\r First you move the the config.yaml of your project to the root folder by typing:\nmv ./config/_default/config.yaml .\r Now open RStudio and install the required package blogdown.

The process is very well explained on their documentation.\nAs advocates for free technology we are going to opt for a second way to modify and deploy your website using your own PC and Github Pages.\nIn this iteration we are going to proceed with the some of the most basic and common ways to modify your website.\nSetting up github First you will need to log-in or create a github account\nNext you will need to create an empty repository where you are going to save your local files from the website build. A detailed set on instructions to this is can be fund this link\nOnce the empty repo is created, with any name you like, for example tutorial_gs, we are ready to copy the contents of your website to the repo.\n  First connect your local repository to the github repo.\n Open a terminal and navigate to the site of your website: cd \u0026lt;your-path\u0026gt;/starter-academic connect to the repo with the online repo by typing: git remote set-url origin \u0026lt;YOUR_REPO_URL\u0026gt;.git For Example git remote set-url origin https://github.com/tutorialgse/tutorial_gs.git To verify the origin type: git remote -v    Next you have to commit the changes you have made\n For this your global user.name and user.email should be configured already on your machine. You can check if that is the case with: git config --list --show-origin if not set yet, you can use : git config --global user.name \u0026quot;John Doe\u0026quot; git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com then add all the changes made to your repo by typing: git add . Now commit all the changes: git commit -m \u0026quot;First commit on the web\u0026quot; Push your repo to your new empty repo typing git push origin master you will be asked for your credentials after this    Now we are going to create the second repo to host the page. For this to work you have to name the repo as follows \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io. Where \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; is the user name that you chose for your account. We will save the generated site to this repository.\nIn your ./config/_default/config.yaml file, set baseurl = \u0026quot;https://\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026quot;\nNext remove the directory ./public.\nWe are going to create the submodule to populate our website deployment repository\ngit submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io.git public\nDeploy your site Generate the website again by typing on the console:\nhugo\rcd publi\rgit add .\rgit commit -m \u0026quot;Build website\u0026quot;\rgit push origin master\rcd ..\r After this, go to \u0026quot;https://\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026quot; and you should be able to see your website.\nUpdating your site To update your websites make your modifications as per the second tutorial.
