I am graduate student at the department of Economics at Emory University. I started in my program in the Fall semester of 2017. Originally, I am from Quito-Ecuador. I obtained my Bachelor degree at PUCE. I spent several years working on policy research in several public institutions in my home country: SRI, INEC, Instituto de la Ciudad. After that I moved to Atlanta, to continue my studies. My area of work is Econometrics, with focus on Networks.
