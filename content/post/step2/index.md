## About this tutorial
Create a Website with RStudio: Modfying your website
================

This is the first part of the tutorial to create a website using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). We
are going to use a particular flavor of Hugo templates called
[Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) (previosuly know as academic Hugo).

With Wowchemy, the default option is to deploy the site using a
subscription based service called [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
The process is very well explained on their
[documentation](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

As advocates for free technology we are going to opt for a second way to
modify and deploy your website using your own PC and [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

In this iteration we are going to proceed with the some of the most
basic and common ways to modify your website.
